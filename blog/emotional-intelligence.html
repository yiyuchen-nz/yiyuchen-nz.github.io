        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <h4>26 April 2022</h4>
        <p>In this blog, I am going to talk about EQ and IQ. You probably heard about EQ and IQ. But what exactly EQ is, what is the difference between EQ and IQ, and how important EQ is? I am going to talk you through all these questions in this blog!</p>
        <h5>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h5>
        <p>EQ stands for emotional quotient or emotional intelligence. It refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, and evaluate emotions. It is essential to have the ability to express and control emotions, while it is also important to have the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions of others. 
         <br> Research shows that there are four different levels of emotional intelligence. They are four steps:</p>
         <ul class="listinblog">
           <li><p>emotional perception: The first step is to accurately perceive emotions through verbal and nonverbal signals, such as body language and facial expressions.</p></li>
           <li><p>the ability to reason using emotions: The second step involves using emotions to promote thinking and cognitive activity.</p></li>
           <li><p>the ability to understand emotions: Emotions might carry a variety of meanings. The next step is to understand the meanings behind emotions.</p></li>
           <li><p>the ability to manage emotions: To have the ability to manage our own emotions as well as to respond to the emotions of others are all important aspects of emotional intelligence. It is the highest level of emotional intelligence.
          </p></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How is it different to IQ?</h5>
        <p>IQ stands for intelligence quotient or cognitive intelligence, which is a measurement of a person's reasoning ability. In short, it means how 'book smart' a person is. Some examples of what IQ can be referred to: the visual processing, working memory, fluid and quantitative reasoning, etc.
          <br>On the other hand, as what was mentioned above, EQ represents individualsâ€™ emotional competencies. Some examples will be identifying emotions, relating to others, and social communication.</p>
          <h5>Why is EQ important?</h5>
          <p>IQ is recognised as an important element of success. But research shows that today IQ is not the only determinant. In fact, success involves a complex array of influences, and emotional intelligence is included. EQ helps us to build stronger relationships, to solve conflicts, to improve job satisfaction, to have a good work-life balance, and to achieve your personal and career goals. </p>
          <p>Having said that, how well do you know about your EQ? Take a quick test <a target="_blank" href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-emotionally-intelligent-are-you-2796099">here</a> to understand how emotionally intelligent are you </p>
