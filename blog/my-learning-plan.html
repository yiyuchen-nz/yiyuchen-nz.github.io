        <h2>My learning plan</h2>
        <h4>23 April 2022</h4>
        <p>In this blog, I am going to talk about my goals and to set a learning plan to help me to reach my goals. </p>
        <h5>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h5>
        <p>My goal at this stage is to successfully graduate from Dev Academy and can secure a junior developer role after graduation. </p>
        <h5>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning.</h5>
        <p>My strengths in terms of learning are passionate, dedicated and open minded. My limitations in terms of learning are overly sensitive, overly idealism and avoid conflicts.</p>
        <h5>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
        <p>Networking and time management in terms of doing projects. I am not good at starting a conversation with a person that I don’t know. But obviously, networking is very important in whichever job market. Time management is about when doing projects, how to make sure it is finished before due.  </p>
        <h5>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h5>
        <p>My time management skill is very poor, but I am working on it. I find both time management tools introduced, Toggle and time-boxes, on Sprint 1 are very useful. On the first day of each sprint, I will quickly flick all pages in that sprint on student handbook to check the time-boxes to plan the study for the whole week. I am trying to set up Toggle Track every time I started to work. I am trying to take breaks at least every an hour to keep my head clear.
        </p>
        <h5>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h5>
        <p>Google is always my first site to ask for help. So far, every problem that I’ve met was solved by searching it online. But if I tried several solutions and I was still stuck at the same place for more than 15mins I would reach out for help to my fellow students and facilitators on Discord.</p>
        <h5>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h5>
        <p>The facilitation team has been amazing. Every question been asked on Discord was answered promptly. If possible, I would like to hear some of our facilitators’ and previous graduates’ stories about their experience, obstacles they’ve met and how they overcame them, etc.</p>
        <h5>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h5>
        <p>I am trying to follow the same schedule everyday. I’ve set a schedule and hopefully I can stick with it. But I will need to block out all the Sundays. That means the due for me is every Saturday night during foundation course. I have a part time work as a sales assistant in retail for couples of hours only on Sundays, for some socialising. Also I like to do grocery shopping with my partner once a week which can be scheduled on Sundays as well. But I will see how it goes, if necessary, I can give up my part time job or ask my partner to do groceries. Not really a big problem. Apart from these, I don’t think there is other commitments for me.</p>
